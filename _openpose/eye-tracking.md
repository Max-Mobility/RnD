title: Eye Tracking Integration
---

An ideal application of OpenPose would be integration with [Gaze
Tracking](../gaze-tracking.md).

The current gaze tracking application needs a description of eye and
face locations within an image.  Openpose generates a json file with
these locations automatically.
