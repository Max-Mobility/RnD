<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">The Co-Chair. A collaborative navigation, steering, and fitness assistant for powered wheelchair users.</code></p>

<p><a href="assets/DiscoveryAwardApplication.pdf" download="download"> Full Application</a></p>

<p>The Co-Chair is an interactive <strong>“plug and play” add-on for any powered wheelchair</strong> that augments traditional controls by collaborating with the user to provide intelligent, semi-autonomous functionality.</p>

<p>The operation of powered wheelchairs (PWC) require both manual and mental dexterity. The user must avoid curbs and drop-offs, important since nearly three-fourths of wheelchair-related injuries are caused by tips and falls, while also navigating terrain and avoiding collisions. <strong>The Co-Chair will increase the users physical and mental health by avoiding these accidents and reducing the cognitive load associated with operating a powered wheelchair.</strong></p>

<p>This will be accomplished by combining low cost <strong>RGB-D “3D” cameras</strong> and an <strong>IMU near the joystick</strong> with a <strong>smartwatch</strong> to have knowledge of both the environment[1][2] and the user’s physiological state[3] so that <strong>inferences about the user intent can lead to contextually aware decisions</strong> allowing the Co-Chair to adaptively update the amount of shared control with the user.</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, the assessors felt that the idea was very feasible and that your idea of using low-costs technologies for your navigation system would make it even more affordable, and that was welcomed. They also felt like the application and the plans were well developed.</p>

  <p>The key weaknesses of your application were: minimal details on the development of the “watch” algorithms, worries around the use of RGB-D cameras that may lead to navigational errors (as they tend to have outdoor limitations). Some assessors also mentioned that similar products were already being developed by a number of laboratories and design projects, and that it was unclear how innovative it would be.</p>

  <p>Also, as you know, the main assessment criteria for the Discovery Award was the level of financial need, and it was felt that offering the award to other applicants would have a bigger impact when it came to supporting their entry to the main Challenge.</p>

  <p>In general, as you can see, your application was well received and I hope this will encourage you to apply for the Main Challenge, deadline 15th August 2018.</p>

<h3 id="gaze-based-semi-autonomy-for-wheelchairs">Gaze-based Semi-autonomy for Wheelchairs</h3>

<p><a href="https://mobilityunlimited.org/people/brain-and-behavior-lab">Mobility Unlimited Page</a></p>

<p><a href="http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/bbl/">Group Website</a></p>

<p>The team aims to develop a low-cost gaze-based intention decoding interface that can be installed on any existing joystick operated electrical wheelchair. Our technology will allow users to drive-by-eye, without the need to interact with a “user interface,” simply navigating as the users imagine where they want to go. This allows users to give high-level driving intentions (“get me out of the room”) instead of having to fiddle around with complicated manoeuvres, these are handled by a semi-autonomous AI for navigation. The system consists of a laptop and off-the-shelf sensors, leading to a low-cost upgrade for any powered wheelchair.</p>
