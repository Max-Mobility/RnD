## Idea

A *smart joystick* that aids the user in navigating their world.  

Specifically a *plug-n-play* device targeting people with ALS to
provide a sliding scale of support throughout their lives.

This device will:

1. Implement alternative controls with scaling complexity
2. Identify and avoid obstacles
3. Infer the intent of the user
4. Identify and react to people
5. Seamlessly share control of the chair between the user and onboard
   systems

> info "What does it mean to react to a person?"
> In its simplest form, people can be treated as just another obstacle
> -- something to be navigated around in the most efficient or
> quickest way possible.
> 
> But in reality, this is not feasible. An individual has their own
> `social space` to be considered. In most cases it is better to
> travel behind an individual than in front when moving around
> them. If two or more individuals are having a conversation, it would
> be very rude to force our way between them.
> 
> Additionally, sometimes a person might not be just another obstacle,
> but instead the user's goal destination. We might want to approach
> them or follow at a set distance.
>
> All of this implies an additional, as-yet-unmentioned capability of
> our device, one that for the moment is out of reach: `contextual
> awareness`. This essentially is the fusion of all of our stated
> capabilities: user input via various controls, estimation of user
> intent, and idenfication of individuals in the environment

The sensor stack on the device wil be capable of meeting all of the
individual's control input needs, from initially being capable of
operating a standard inductive joystick, to control through head
movement, all the way to gaze detection.
