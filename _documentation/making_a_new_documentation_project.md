title: Making a New Project
---

Setting up a new project documentation page consists of four steps:

1. Make a new folder within the root directory named `_project_name`
2. Make a file in the root directory named `project_name.md` to
   serve as the project landing page
3. Add an `about.md` file within the project directory
4. Edit `_config.yaml` in the root directory to let the site know of
   the new project subfolder and landing page
   
To illustrate these steps, this guide will create documentation for a
sample project named `My Project` with the site located in `~/RnD`


# Make a project folder

```bash
cd ~/RnD

mkdir _my-project
```

`_my-project` can contain any number of files and subdirectories, so
feel free to go wild. 

# Make a landing page .md file 

A template for the landing file is located ...

```bash
cd ~/RnD


```
