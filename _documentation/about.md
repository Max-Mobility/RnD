# Site Layout

This site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

Each project being documented is separated into its own subfolder that contains all
files pertaining to that project (markdown documentation, images,
etc). Each subfolder has the nameing scheme of `_project_name` so that the
folder can be recognized as a Jekyll collection for ease of use.

The only file for each project not contained within this folder is a
markdown file in this repo's root directory to serve as the landing page
for the project. It has the nameing scheme of `project_name.md`. 

# Documentation How-To

Follow the links in the table of contents below to learn how to set up a
local copy of this site and create and maintain documentation.

A reminder that you can use the [editor on
GitHub](https://github.com/Max-Mobility/RnD/edit/master/README.md) to
maintain and preview the content of the site.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in this site, from the
content in your Markdown files.

**All documentation on this site will be made using markdown.** No other
knowledge should be necessary to get started.
