title: About

This is an example `about` page for a topic. Think of this as the landing page where an executive summary of the project is presented. Don't worry about creating a table of contents or a list of links on this page (unless you just really want to), because it will be auto generated if you have followed all the directions for setting up a new topic.

As always, this page is written using markdown. A refresher on syntax can be found [here](../_documentation/markdown.md)
